# Project Overview:

## PROJECT TURING TEXT

The Turing Text project is an SMS text-based application designed to run the Turing Test between ChatGPT (an AI language model) and a human participant. The goal is to evaluate the AI's ability to imitate human-like conversation and determine whether it can be distinguished from a real person.

The project involves multiple roles, including human agents (participants), evaluators (judges), and AI agents (ChatGPT). Human agents and evaluators are paired in the game, while AI agents participate by providing responses. The game proceeds by sending prompts to both human agents and AI agents, and they respond accordingly.

Evaluators compare the responses and generate a result based on the similarity between AI-generated and human-generated responses.

The system uses the Twilio API to enable communication through SMS messages. A delegator class analyzes incoming messages from users, assigns roles as human agents or evaluators, and pairs them for the game. The HelpTool generates prompts and notifies paired participants when they are ready to start the game.

A Game class manages individual game sessions involving a human agent, an evaluator, and an AI agent. The GameBook class keeps track of all game sessions and saves the data for future analysis.

Overall, the project aims to create an engaging, interactive experience where human participants and AI agents can communicate, and evaluators can assess the AI's performance in generating human-like conversation.

Here's a summary of all the classes in the updated UML diagram, their responsibilities, and their relationships:

1. SMSInterface: Handles communication with the Twilio API for sending and receiving messages.
   - Connects to the Twilio API and webhook.
   - Sends and receives messages to/from the Delegator.
2. Player: A superclass for Human and AI participants in the game.
   - Parent class for Human and AI.
3. Human: Represents human participants and stores their phone number.
   - Inherits from Player.
   - Parent class for HumanAgent and Evaluator.
4. AI: Represents AI participants and stores their API token.
   - Inherits from Player.
   - Participates in the Game.
5. HumanAgent: Represents human users who play the game.
   - Inherits from Human.
   - Gets paired with an Evaluator by the Delegator.
   - Participates in the Game.
   - Receives prompts from HelpTool.
6. Evaluator: Represents human users who evaluate the game responses.
   - Inherits from Human.
   - Gets paired with a HumanAgent by the Delegator.
   - Participates in the Game.
   - Compares responses and generates Results.
   - Receives prompts from HelpTool.
7. Results: Stores the evaluation results, including the score and comparison.
   - Generated by the Evaluator.
8. Delegator: Analyzes messages from users, assigns roles, and pairs HumanAgents and Evaluators.
   - Receives messages from SMSInterface.
   - Assigns HumanAgent, Evaluator, and AI to the Game.
   - Keeps track of games in the GameBook.
9. HelpTool: Generates prompts and notifies HumanAgents and Evaluators when they are paired.
   - Generates prompts for HumanAgent and Evaluator.
10. Game: Manages a single game session involving a HumanAgent, an Evaluator, and an AI.
    - Starts and ends the game session.
    - Saves game data to the GameBook.
11. GameBook: Keeps track of all game sessions and saves their data.
    - Adds games to the record.
    - Saves game data.

These classes interact and collaborate to manage the game sessions, handle communication with users, delegate roles, and evaluate game results.
