# Revised Project Overview

The Turing Test SMS Application is designed to facilitate a Turing Test between an AI and a human participant via SMS. The project comprises multiple roles, including human participants (agents and evaluators), and AI agents. The system leverages the Twilio API to enable communication through SMS messages.

### Class Responsibilities and Relationships

1. **SMSCommunicationManager**: This class communicates with the Twilio API to send and receive SMS messages.

2. **GameParticipant**: An abstract class that outlines common methods required for both HumanParticipant and AIAgent classes.

3. **HumanParticipant**: This class, inheriting from GameParticipant, maintains details of a human participant such as phone number. Has two subclasses: 'HumanAgent' and 'Evaluator'.

4. **AIAgent**: Also a subclass of GameParticipant, AIAgent keeps the API token of an AI participant and generates responses using the GPT model.

5. **TuringTestSession**: Responsible for managing a single game session involving a HumanAgent, an Evaluator, and an AIAgent. TuringTestSession generates a GameOutcome at the conclusion of each game.

6. **GameOutcome**: This class stores the evaluation results, including the score and comparison. It also offers methods for calculating and formatting the results.

7. **ParticipantRoleCoordinator**: It receives messages from SMSCommunicationManager, assigns roles to human participants, pairs HumanAgents and Evaluators, and initiates and concludes games.

8. **GamePrompter**: This class generates prompts and notifies HumanAgents and Evaluators when they are paired for a game.

9. **GameArchive**: GameArchive keeps all TuringTestSession instances and their GameOutcomes. It provides methods to query or analyze the game data.

This revised design ensures that each class has a specific responsibility, and inter-class dependencies are minimized. The class names are made more descriptive to provide a clear indication of their role within the system.
